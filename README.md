Tool for launchpad mini for any program controlling.
[Created with VS2019 | .NET C# standart console project]

To use:
- Run with administrator rights (!It`s just not working without them!)
- For input choose the last number
- For output select Launchpad Mini
After that, buttons A B C D E G H will be light up. You can use first five for coloring main 64 pads. 
H resets all pads and delete savings. G disable coloring. F enable coloring.
Your settings will be automatically saved.

Then, set up launchpad in your DAW in keybindings

I will create a video soon about program. Also, I should add comments in code...
